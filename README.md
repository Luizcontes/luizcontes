## LUIZ CONTES
### Software engineer - Fullstack - Developer

After participating in a bootcamp which introduced me to information technology I got interested in a JavaScript Fullstack developer role. Since the beginning of 2022 I`ve been mainly studying JavaScript as my core tecnology, and now I am mastering in deepth some libraries wich will help me to improve my skills as a fullstack developer such as:

`NodeJs - React - Express - Axios - JWT`

Some of other technologies I am focused on:

`GIT - PostgreSQL - MongoDB - Docker`

I have some years of working experience in other fields which makes me good at problem solving, business oriented and excel in team environment, part os this experienced envolved managing my own bussines and having to make decisions for the best of this endeavour, main challenges I embraced:

**Managing a family bussines**

**Leaving abroad and learning new languages and culture**

**Sabatic year around South America**

I like to think about myself as a very curious and driven person who loves to talk and meet people. I love to travel, I enjoy the summer and what gives meaning to my life is my 2 little angels whom I call my daughters ðŸ˜Š
